## 1. Pyramid Generator

Implemented Pyramid Generator

- Utilized the `#` character to generate a pyramid structure.
- Created a `padRow` function to build rows, applying the correct spacing and character alignment based on the row number.
- Introduced an `inverted` boolean flag to allow toggling between normal and inverted pyramid generation.
- Made the pyramid height configurable using the `count` variable.
- Added logic to construct and store rows in the `rows `array, either in a regular or inverted order.
- The final output is a formatted string, which is printed to the `console`.
